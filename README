The Logger works to synchronize all of the error and debug logs across all of the nodes in the application. 

usage is as follows: 


1. 	clone/download the IT490-Logging repo. 
2.	Create a symbolic link in the directory of the code you want to implement logging in 

3. 	In each function, create an instance of the logger:
	$[variable-name] = new logger('[file->function]','[rabbit file]');

	make sure to include the logger as well:
	require_once(Logger.php.inc)

4.	To send send something to the log, use the following:

	errors:
		$[variable-name]->logError('[Log Type]','[Error Level]', '[Log  Message]')

	debug:
		$[variable-name]->logDebug('[Log Type]','[Log Message]')

	
	Error Type - This should be bascially the subject of the log message. a short phrase that describes what the message is in reference type 

	Error Level - The standard levels: Error Warning, Etc. 

	Log Message - The specific information about the thing you are logging.
